This is my work for the Millipore Sigma Data Science Intern coding challenge, submitted on January 24th, 2024.

Below are some of the links containing the data that I used to perform my analysis:

COVID-19 Patient Data:

- https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data-with-Ge/n8mc-b4w4/about_data
- https://emd-coding-challenge.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/covid-19-aqi/covid19/cases.csv.bz2

To acheive similar results with this data, I'd highly recommend taking a look at
the data dictionary for this dataset.

Air Quality Index (AQI) Data:
Under "Daily AQI by County", years 2019-2021:
